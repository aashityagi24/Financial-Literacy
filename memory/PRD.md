# CoinQuest - Financial Literacy Learning App for Children

## Original Problem Statement
A gamified financial literacy learning application for children (K-5) with distinct user roles (Teacher, Parent, Child, Admin). Features include a digital wallet, virtual store, gamified investment modules (Money Garden & Stock Market), dynamic quests, achievements, and hierarchical content system. Currency: Indian Rupees (₹).

### Content Management ✅

## Pending/Backlog

### P1 - High Priority
- [ ] Streak Bonuses (7-day, 30-day milestones)
- [ ] Leaderboards
- [ ] Spending limits & parent approval for large transactions

### P2 - Medium Priority
- [ ] Backend refactor (split server.py into modules)
- [ ] Teacher/Parent collaboration portal
- [ ] Collaborative & seasonal events
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Tutorial system

### Technical Debt
- `/app/backend/server.py` - Over 8000 lines, needs modular refactoring
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/ContentManagement.jsx` - Over 1500 lines, needs component decomposition
