# PocketQuest - Financial Literacy Platform for K-5 Kids

## Original Problem Statement
Create a financial literacy gamified learning activity for children (K-5, ages 5-11) with teacher, parent and child login. Features include grade-level progression, classroom economy system, virtual wallet with spending/savings/investing/giving accounts, virtual store, investment simulations, mini-games, quest system, avatar customization, badges/achievements, daily login rewards, and educational guardrails.

**Key Requirement**: Learning comes FIRST - children learn about different financial literacy aspects (barter system, gold/silver coins, modern currency, needs vs wants, savings, spending, earning). Then they practice with the digital economy tools.

## User Personas
1. **Child (K-5 Students)**: Primary users who learn financial concepts through educational content then practice with gamified activities
2. **Parent**: Monitor child progress, set up chores, give digital rewards, manage allowances
3. **Teacher**: Set up classroom economies, track student progress, reward financial learning, create challenges
4. **Admin**: Manage content (topics, lessons, books, activities), manage users, view platform statistics

## Core Requirements
- Google Social Login authentication for regular users
- **Admin email/password authentication** (admin@learnersplanet.com / finlit@2026)
- Grade-level appropriate content (K-5)
- **Hierarchical Content System** (primary focus)
  - Topics → Subtopics → Content Items
  - Content types: Lessons, Books, Worksheets (PDF), Activities (HTML)
  - Thumbnails for topics, subtopics, and content

- Quests and achievements system
- Daily login rewards and streaks
- AI chatbot for financial questions (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- Admin dashboard for content management
- **Teacher Dashboard** for classroom management
- **Parent Dashboard** for chore/allowance management
