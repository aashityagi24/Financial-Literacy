Dashboard.jsx fetches savings goals via /api/child/savings-goals and displays the first active (non-completed) goal. WalletPage.jsx has 'Add to Goal' button that opens allocation dialog - when there's only 1 active goal, it auto-displays without dropdown; when multiple goals exist, a dropdown selector is shown. The contribute endpoint at /api/child/savings-goals/{goal_id}/contribute deducts from savings account and adds to goal's current_amount. Goals are marked completed when current_amount >= target_amount."
